# DoctorBot
DoctorBot is an AI application where people can put in patient information, and using Gemini and Google data, personalized recommendations for the patient and potential diagnoses would be made. In addition to this, the user can have an interactive “conversation” with the AI so that they can get the most information and ask specific questions. This project investigates Generative AI's potential to provide accurate, personalized, and accessible healthcare solutions.
